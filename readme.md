# Gists watcher

This project is meant to be used for security researchers, so when ever a new paste/gist is made on popular websites, sec researchers get notified

This could also be used to automatically detect leaks of emails, passwords, credit cards etc

## Sources (currently scraping):

- [Github gists](https://api.github.com/gists/public)
- [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/archive)

More to be added soon
